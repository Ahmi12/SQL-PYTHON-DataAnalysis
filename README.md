Project: E-commerce Data Analysis using SQL & Python
Description:

This project focuses on extracting meaningful business insights from a real-world e-commerce dataset using a combination of SQL for data querying and Python for analysis and visualization.

Using structured SQL queries, I explored customer behavior, order trends, sales performance, and retention patterns. The results were further processed and visualized using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook.

üîç Key Analyses Performed:
Sales Trend Analysis: Calculated total and cumulative sales on a monthly and yearly basis to identify revenue trends over time.

Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth: Measured the annual growth in total sales to evaluate business performance.

Customer Retention: Identified customers who made a repeat purchase within 6 months of their first order and calculated the retention rate.

Top Customers by Year: Ranked customers based on total spending each year and extracted the top 3 per year.

Order Patterns: Analyzed average order value and product quantity per order.

üìä Visualizations:
Bar charts for yearly and monthly sales

Line graph for YoY growth

Dual-axis plot for retention trends

Pie chart for payment method distribution

Heatmaps for category-wise review scores

‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies:
SQL: MySQL (for querying and aggregations)

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook: For code, analysis, and visual storytelling

‚úÖ Outcome:
Discovered that customer retention within 6 months was approximately X%

Identified major growth from year A to year B, with YoY growth of Y%

Top 3 customers contributed significantly to yearly revenue

Gained insights to support business decisions in marketing and customer engagement
